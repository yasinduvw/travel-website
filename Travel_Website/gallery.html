                            <p>Commissioned under the British in the year 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge stands proudly, 
							a testament to the engineering and architectural brilliance of the early 20th century. 
							Ideally placed between the Ella and Demodara railway station, those choosing to walk 
							along the bridge will be presented with scenes of rolling hills and dense jungle to delight in.

                            The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed by connecting 
							two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla – Colombo railway. 
							This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet in height. 
							It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. 
							The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on Gotuwala road starting from Halpe 
							Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela road.
							The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the bridge’s architectural
							ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.

                            Arguably the best time to venture out would be during when the locomotives come barrelling
							along and thus it is advisable to check on the train schedule in advance.
							However, be sure to carry your trusty cam with you so that you might capture every moment 
							that unravels before you.

                            <p>Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting 
							of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a 
							remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs
							the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is 
							some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain.
							The Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (reigned 477–495) built a palace in the shape of a
							monumental lion on the several acres of ground at the summit, intending it to be a 
							safeguard against his enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace 
							fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination, however, and it is now 
							a popular tourist spot. Visitors begin the final ascent to the top through the open
							paws of the lion, one of the few remaining portions of the palace that are still intact. 
							Also notable are 21 rock paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers).
							Sigiriya was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.

							<!--references:http://www.jetwinghotels.com/islandinsider/the-insiders-guide-to-yala/-->
                            <p>Yala National Park is the most popular wildlife destination in Sri Lanka because 
							of the high chance of encounter and variety of animals. Its diversity of bird, 
							mammal and reptile life is unrivalled in the country and there are particularly high 
							densities of its two keystone species: elephants and leopards. Current estimates suggest 
							there are around 70 leopards and, as the apex predator in the park, they’re top cat here 
							so less fearful than in countries like Africa where lions rule the roost. 
							This means you’re more likely to see a leopard here than anywhere else in the world.

							It is one of the secret gems of Sri Lanka which has everything to make your holiday

							Jungle Beach offers a plethora of water sports such as snorkelling, scuba diving,

							make a good site for snorkelling which introduces you to the exotic marine life of the region. 
							Apart from schools of colourful fishes you will spot moray eels, encounter crabs, barracudas,
							trigger fish and many other reef dwelling creatures. The other activities you can indulge in
							Jungle Beach include whale watching, visiting historical ruins, jungle hiking and many more.

							<p>Galle is located in the south of Sri Lanka. A journey to the past sees the remnants 
							of a Dutch past at a World Heritage Site. Galle has been the emporium of foreign trade 
							since the dawn of commerce. The Dutch Fort, which has been declared a World Heritage Site,
							surrounds the older part of the town and is situated on a headland of which three sides 
							overlook the sea. The ramparts of the Fort are over 2.5 km in circumference and provide 
							a pleasant and interesting walk. The historian Sir Emerson Tennant claimed that Galle was
							the ancient biblical city of Tarshish. This city is said to have traded with King Solomon,
							the Persians and the Egyptians. In 1505 a Portuguese fleet led by Lorenzo de Almeida heading
							for the Maldives drifted accidentally into Galle. On hearing a cock crowing 
							(cock means ”Galo” in Portuguese), it is said that they gave the town its name. 
							Another explanation for the name is from the Sinhala name for rock ‘Gala’, plenty of which are
							found in the harbour area.
